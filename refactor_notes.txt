1. Make separate scraper classes for each publication (supported by a scraper module)
2. Make it so that each Object only knows about a max of one other object.
3. Eliminate magic numbers.
4. Don't use 'singleton' classes.  Make a new instance of each scraper object(one for each website) and store things like its html in instance variables like @doc.
